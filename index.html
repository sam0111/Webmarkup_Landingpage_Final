                        </header>

                        <p>Haarlem is the capital of the province Noord-Holland.
                            The city is a nicer version of Amsterdam which is only a short train ride away from Haarlem.
                            The center of Haarlem is a 10 minute walk away from Haarlem station.
                            Haarlem station is one of the oldest train stations of the netherlands.
                            You could take the bus at the station that stops by the center, for example the bus 300
                            stops at
                            the center.</p>

                        <p>The city center used to be known for having the blooming flower district,
                            but now it is known for many things
                            the hidden court yard "De Hofjes", and its many museums.
                            It also has one of the most beautiful architecture of the Netherlands, which is worth coming
                            for.
                        </p>

                        At first sight you might think theres not a lot to do in the center,but that is not true.
                        There are a lot of fun activities to do in the center of Haarlem and there is something for
                        everyone
                        even for you.
                    </p>

                    <p class="text">
                        You could go shopping, go museum hopping or maybe visit the church.
                        Haarlem Center has many shops in the main road.
                        The church of Haarlem is located in the "heart" of center.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        You can go look for the little gems in the allay beside the main path.
                        There are many restaurants and cafes too so you can just take aak whenever you feel like it
                        and
                        drink some coffee. The center of Haarlem has many nice terraces to sit and relax.
                        Or maybe you want to do something less PG family friendly there are many "coffeeshops" you could
                        visit,
                        Most of those shops do not actually sell coffee so be aware.
